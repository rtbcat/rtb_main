            <p class="left max-850">
                Real-time offers for inventory, from multiple buyers, on an impression by impression basis creating a marketplace for advertisers to bring their own audience/customer data to TV advertising.

                A television broadcast (noun) is a program that is transmitted one-to-many over airwaves for public reception by anyone with a receiver tuned to the right signal channel. Because it uses the public airwaves, it is subject to regulation by the FCC; signal can  be allowed to be retransmitted by the owner through other means beyond the airwaves, like a cable or satellite system. 
            </p>
            <h3>Connected TV</h3>

Some examples include Roku, Apple TV, Chromecast, Samsung SmartTV, etc.
