				<h2>Buying from exchanges </h2>
				<p class="left">
					One way of picturing the <b>ad-exchange</b> is like a marketplace where Networks come to show their goods. Ppicture the list of companies below, all in one auction-room. This is an exchange.
					You as a buyer sit in the middle and you can buy from:<br>
					- Google<br>
					- Yahoo<br>
					- Microsoft (incl. MSN.com, Skype, or even the Windows 8 & 10 Start button)<br>
					- AOL network<br>
					- Facebook <br>
					- eBay<br>
					- More recently some native networks have appeared on the exchange, like Taboola, ShareThrough, TripleLift and more.<br><br>
					To understand what's happening when you launch your campaign, you need to remember the following:<br>
					The Networks have given their publishers their software to put ads on their site, eg: CNN, HuffingtonPost or Weather.com. <br>To stop that webmaster from switching to a competitor, they need to sell as much of that ad-space as possible. What doesn't get sold in direct-deals gets passed to the open market.
					The price is usually determined by:<br>
					- top-dollar, spot-prices<br>
					- commiting to buying for many months<br>
					(It helps if you have a popular brand)<br>
					Now, that's great for Volume. <b>But what about Quality?</b><br>
					</p>
					<h2>Three ways of selecting the right audience:</h2>
					<p class="left">
					1. You Buy an audience from:<br><br>
					- AdWords' in-market or affinity audiences section<br>
					- Facebook demographic data is unparraleled<br>
					- Amazon let's you target on what people's buying history<br>
					- Apple iAd: let's you match people with what's already on their phone<br>
					Then you re-target into the exchange.<br><br>
					This means you first buy the exact demographic you need for your product. And then retarget them<br>
					2. Buy DATA. <br>You can actually reserve all of that traffic and filter out those people you want such as <i>HomeOwner, good credit score,</i> etc. And only show your ad to the ones that fit that criteria - and you only pay for that.<br><br>
					3. Find publishers that mainly have that audience, such as NewsMax has mainly male BabyBoomers, Snapchat has millenials, etc.<br>
					There are also combinations of the above, like: <i>buy only NewsMax but filter out anyone not a HomeOwner</i><br>
					Of course the traffic divides into: desktop, mobile and video. <br>
					So you could tag the NewsMax visitors and then show them a video when they go to Facebook or Twitter<br>
					You could segment a "car-enthusiasts" audience inside Facebook, and <b>target them on Spotify</b> or at the bottom of any news-article through the Taboola network.<br>
					You can tag affluent business owners on Bloomberg and <b>target them on LinkedIn.</b><br>
					There are many, many combinations<br>
