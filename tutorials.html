                <h2>Buying from exchanges </h2>
                <p>
                    One way of picturing the <b>ad-exchange</b> is like a marketplace where Networks come to show their goods. Picture the list of companies below, all in one auction-room. 
                    
                    - Google<br>
                    - Yahoo<br>
                    - Microsoft (incl. MSN.com, Skype, or even the Windows 8 & 10 Start button)<br>
                    - AOL network<br>
                    - Facebook <br>
                    - eBay<br>
                    <b>This</b> is an "exchange". <br> 
                    You as a buyer sit in the middle and you can buy from any or all of them.<br>
                    More recently some native networks have appeared on the exchange, like Taboola, ShareThrough, TripleLift, GumGum and more.<br><br>
                    To understand what's happening when you launch your campaign, you need to remember the following:<br>
                    The Networks have given their publishers their software to put ads on their site, eg: CNN, HuffingtonPost or Weather.com. <br>To stop that webmaster from switching to a competitor, they need to sell as much of that ad-space as possible. What doesn't get sold in direct-deals gets passed to the open market.
                    The price is usually determined by:<br>
                    - top-dollar, spot-prices<br>
                    - commiting to buying for many months<br>
                    (It helps if you have a popular brand)<br>
                    Now, that's great for Volume. <b>But what about Quality?</b><br>
                </p>
                <h2>Three ways of selecting the right audience:</h2>
                <p>
                    1. You Buy an audience from:<br><br>
                    - AdWords' in-market or affinity audiences section<br>
                    - Facebook demographic data is unparraleled<br>
                    - Amazon let's you target on what people's buying history<br>
                    - Apple iAd: let's you match people with what's already on their phone<br>
                    Then you re-target into the exchange.<br><br>
                    This means you first buy the exact demographic you need for your product. And then retarget them<br>
                    2. Buy DATA. <br>You can actually reserve all of that traffic and filter out those people you want such as <i>HomeOwner, good credit score,</i> etc. And only show your ad to the ones that fit that criteria - and you only pay for that.<br><br>
                    3. Find publishers that mainly have that audience, such as NewsMax has mainly male BabyBoomers, Snapchat has millenials, etc.<br>
                    There are also combinations of the above, like: <i>buy only NewsMax but filter out anyone not a HomeOwner</i><br>
                    Of course the traffic divides into: desktop, mobile and video. <br>
                    So you could tag the NewsMax visitors and then show them a video when they go to Facebook or Twitter<br>
                    You could segment a "car-enthusiasts" audience inside Facebook, and <b>target them on Spotify</b> or at the bottom of any news-article through the Taboola network.<br>
                    You can tag affluent business owners on Bloomberg and <b>target them on LinkedIn.</b><br>
                    There are many, many combinations<br>
