<h2>Processing and Shipping Information</h2>
<p>What you need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>All shipments are pending transaction approval and merchandise availability.</li>
<li>Orders are processed and shipped Monday-Friday. </li>
<li>Note that orders are not processed or shipped on weekends or US Postal holidays.</li>
<li>Processing and shipping time does not allow for any issues that may occur regarding payment authorization or insufficient/invalid shipping address information.</li>
<li>Once an order has been processed, the shipment cannot be cancelled.</li>
<li>All orders are shipped via US Postal Service, according to USPS standards and regulations.</li>
<li>International Customers: please note that customs fees/import duties, taxes and other charges are not
included in the amount of your purchase. These fees are the </li>
<li>responsibility of the buyer, and are imposed according to the customs regulations for your country.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Domestic Orders:</b>
Once orders are processed for shipping, the projected delivery time is generally within 3-5 business days for domestic (US) packages.
</p>
<p><b>International Orders:</b><br>
Processing time does not allow for any issues that may occur regarding payment authorization or insufficient/invalid shipping address information.</p>
<p>Transit times can vary per country, but most international orders are generally received by the destination’s postal facility within ~2-3 weeks of
the ship date. However, it is possible for packages to be held in customs, as well as at the destination’s postal facility, which can add further delay.</p>
<p><b>Tracking Information:</b><br>
At the time of purchase, you will receive an email notification containing confirmation of your purchase. This notification will also contain the login
details for your account, which gives you immediate online access to any programs/reading materials purchased. </p>
<p>You can access your shipping details via our Customer Support Web Portal. Once logged in, click on the Tracking Tab.</p>
<p>Note, the tracking number assigned to your order is not recognized until ~24 hours after the item has been shipped. This allows time for the
information to be processed and updated in the online tracking system. </p>
<p>If you have not received your order within a reasonable amount of time (according to the timelines listed above), please contact us to verify
the accuracy of your shipping address, and we will gladly reship your order, if necessary.</p>
<p><b>International Tracking:</b><br>
The USPS tracking number assigned to your order will provide shipping status within US boundaries. However, this number will not provide shipment
status for most international orders once the item has left the US, unless the receiving country’s postal system has registered with the USPS
Tracking System. To check the status of your shipment beyond the US boundaries, please contact your country’s customs office or local postal
facility for more information. </p>
