        <p><a href="/x700" target="_blank"><img src="images/building.jpg" align="right" width="320"></a>
        </p><p>With the rise of domestic terrorism and stricter gun laws to contend with, American's are searching for better ways to protect themselves and their families against crime. </p>
        <p>The solution? Tactical flashlights. These are becoming such popular self-defense tools in the wake of recent terror events that some tactical flashlight companiescan't keep up with demand.</p>
        <blockquote><i> &quot;We had to open up a second factory just to keep up with the massive amounts of orders coming in.&quot;</i> </blockquote>
        <p>An innovative new company has taken incredible archived LED technology and placed it inside Tactical Flashlights called the X700... </p>
        <p>These revolutionary devices are made from military-grade matereals and are the brightest and most intense flashlights on the market.</p>
        <p>Compact LEDs have led to smaller flashlights that put out more light   while using a fraction of the energy their old-fashioned counterparts   use... but before you run out to Home Depot to buy any old LED   flashlight, you need to know about this new tactical flashlight called the   X700 which uses recently released military technology now available to   the public.</p>
        <p>The X700 Tactical Flashlight is currently the most popular tactical flashlight of choice for most American's due to it's powerfully disorienting &quot;strobe mode&quot; that allows the user to flash a blinding strobe light into the attackers eyes, leaving them &quot;disoriented beyond belief.&quot;</p>
        <h2>How effective are tactical flashlights, really?</h2>
        <p>Ask any fireman, police officer, military man, survivalist or hunter     and they'll tell you how critical it is for them to have a flashlight   at   their disposal at all times... and for them, not just any   flashlight   will do.  Those clunky plastic halogen flashlights that   require C or D   batteries are practically worthless - they're just too   heavy, too dim,   and too easily broken.</p>
        <p>Thankfully, <strong>recent advancements in lighting technology</strong> have taken flashlights to the next level. Compact LEDs have led to     smaller flashlights that put out more light while using a fraction of     the energy their old-fashioned counterparts use..</p>
        <p>If you've ever had someone take a picture of you at night with the flash on, you'll know how it takes a minute or two for your eyes to re-adjust. Now imagine that flash is 100x brighter and is strobing directly into your eyes. You wouldn't be able to see a thing, and would most likely lose your sense of balance. </p>
        <p> <img src="images/h12.jpg" width="362" height="217" align="right" style="margin-left:10px;">The strobe feature is designed to ruin an attacker's eye sight, so they can't see what they're doing, letting you safely run away- or if need be, gain the advantage and attack them.</p>
        <p>The truth is, most people underestimate the importance of owning a tactical flashlight. Whether you're walking alone at night, driving somewhere and break down, or just want a light bright enough to deter animals while you're camping, tactical flashlights are so bright they give you the advantage.</p>
        <p>Not to mention if you're in an emergency situation, what better way to call attention to yourself than with a powerful light that can be seen for up to 2 miles away!</p>
        <p>Tactical flashlights like the <a href="http://insider-financial-tips.com//x700" target="_blank">X700 Tactical Flashlight</a> are <strong>used by the U.S. Navy Seals, the Coast Guard, Firemen, Policemen, U.S. Search and Rescue</strong> and now American citizens.</p>
        <blockquote><i>&quot;In times like these, it's more important than ever for Americans to be prepared for anything, and this flashlight is one of the best pieces of gear to have as it can be used in almost every situation, from self defense to finding your dog at night...&quot;</i></blockquote>
        <p>95% of American households are not ready for emergency preparedness   because ordinary flashlights simply do not output enough light. The   truth is, the typical flashlight is a decades-old technology with a very   limited range of sight that is dangerous in an emergency situation. </p>
        <p> Many police officers, firefighter, hunters, campers, and military   forces know just how mission critical having a powerful, tactical   flashlight can be for survival. Regular flashlights are weak,   halogen-based devices that are too easily broken, heavy and are too dim   for modern standards.</p>
        <p>It features a &quot;Light Beam&quot; feature (as seen in the actual photo   above) that produces a light so powerful that it can turn a pitch-black   night to daylight with the flick of a switch. An &quot;SOS mode&quot; can be   activated to signal for help and the &quot;Strobe mode&quot; can temporarily   disorient and blind a threat.<strong> </strong>If you want to make sure you and your loved ones are always prepared for the worst, this flashlight is a great start. It has our vote so much that we made sure everyone on our staff had at least 4.</p>
