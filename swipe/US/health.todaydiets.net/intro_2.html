I lost a total of 10 lbs after taking this supplement for one month. It's a nice alternative to working out since I'm a very busy person. I didn't even change my diet the whole time I was taking this. Overall, it worked for me and it is great.

I lost 20 lbs in two and half months by taking this slimfy weight loss. It's inexpensive and effective so I'm giving it five stars. Now I maintain my weight by eating clean and running everyday. I don't recall any negative side effects. Thanks You for such great product.

Physical tolerance occurs when an organism builds up a resistance to the effects of a substance after repeated exposure. Decreased quantity of the substance reaching the site it affects. This is usually caused by an increase in induction of the enzymes required for degradation of the supplement. In other words, tolerance is a reduced response to repeated administration of the same dose or increase in the dose is required to produce the same magnitude of response. Once we begin to take supplement on a regular basis the dose response goes down - the same dose of medication produces less effect than it used to. Saying that the dose response to medication goes down is exactly the same as saying that medication tolerance goes up (and vice versa). Dose response and tolerance are mirror images of each other. As long as a steady use of medication is maintained, tolerance will tend to increase and dose response will tend to drop. In order to avoid this and get the expected result switching the products to those with different content or adding new ingredients is required. </div> </div> <div class="landing_div5"> <div style="float:left; margin:50px 0px 0px 90px; with:400px; height:auto; "> <img src="https://bc438d8e289ed2760a39-dc02833d89fe9986d76757df581c3b49.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/global/landings/001/images/slimfy-metabolic-activity-chart.jpg" width="389" height="265" border="0" alt="Slimfy Matabolic Activity Comparison Chart" title="Slimfy Matabolic Activity Comparison Chart"> </div> <div style=" float:right; width:440px; margin:30px 40px 0px 0px;"> <h1 style=" white-space:nowrap; font-size:25px; line-height:28px;"> You have nothing to lose <br> ...Except for the belly fat </h1> <div style=" width:430px; "> <p style="margin:10px 0px 0px 0px;"> Our formulas include some of the most effective, weight loss ingredients in the market: Green Coffee Bean Extract, Raspberry Ketone, Caralluma Fimbriata and more.

My colleagues and I were very surprised after carefully examining the contents of this product. I have concluded that this wasn't just a random cluster of some popular ingredients (as it seemed). After the analysis I had to admit - the concept of suppressing the tolerance effect and combination of the ingredients, aligned with specific timeframes could serve as a perfectly balanced and efficient solution to safe and effective weight loss. Slimfy with CoQ10, Saffron and Resveratrol can also help support your health in general. This is truly a fascinating product!

I have been using the product for 5 weeks and like how it reduces my appetite. I gave one to my husband and he fell in love with them, he says they lowered his appetite as well.

I don't have a lot to lose and already I lost about 3.5 pounds in first 2 weeks without changing my diet, I found it to be a wonderful appetite suppressant and energy boost. I've been on it for about 5 weeks and have lost over 10 lbs with NO change to my diet and NO excercise routine.
