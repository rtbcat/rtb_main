            For the past couple of months our readers have been bombarding us with questions and going crazy about something called the <span style="font-style: italic; color:#333;  font-weight:600; ">  “tolerance buildup suppressing method”. </span> This new and controversial discovery - when applied correctly, has been reported to dramatically boost the weight loss process. A couple of products that employ this method have been featured on several popular TV shows, so we thought it was just advertiser hype. But seeing how thousands of women have been blogging and sharing their incredible success stories, via Facebook and Twitter, we decided to investigate.
        </div>
        <div class="head1 Slabo27px-Regular">Anna Cortes lost 77 kilograms and found herself.</div>

        <div class="imgBox"> <img class="img1" width="80%" src="images/mid_age_17.jpg"> </div>
        <div class="contText open-sans">
            One of our readers, Anna Cortes had been repeatedly warned by her doctor that her weight of 148 kilograms could drastically shorten her life, but then 3 years ago she was diagnosed with Type II diabetes. To make matters worse, the news came at a time when Anna's relationship with her husband seemed to be coming completely undone.
            <span style="font-style: italic; color:#333; font-weight:600; "> "I was extremely depressed and food was my only comfort," </span> Anna explained.

            <span style="font-style: italic; color:#333;  font-weight:600; "> "It was the only thing I felt I could turn to when everything around me was falling apart."</span>
        </div>

        <div class="contText open-sans">
            <div class="inner" style="max-width: 600px;">
                <div class="Slabo27px-Regular" style="font-style: italic; padding-bottom: 20px; ">“When I started taking pictures at the beginning, I hated the way I looked.”</div>
                <img width="550" src="images/story3.jpg">
            </div>
            Even though she reached her highest weight in 2015, Anna says she struggled with weight all throughout her adolescent and teen years. She recalls being <span style="font-style: italic; color:#333;  font-weight:600; ">"the fat one"</span> in school and mindlessly eating to cope with the difficulties of not growing up with her biological father.
            <span style="font-style: italic; color:#333;  font-weight:600; ">
           "But more than anything, my weight really got out of control when my stepfather died just after my wedding. By that time, I couldn't do a lot of things, like fit on an airplane seat, fasten seatbelt, or walk long distances without being tired and feeling pain in my joints."
 </span>

            <br><br>
            <span style="font-style: italic; color:#333;  font-weight:600; ">
            "I missed out on snorkeling in the Caribbean for my honeymoon. I couldn't go hiking, zip lining, or even biking—all things I dreamed about,"</span> said Anna.

            <span style="font-style: italic; color:#333;  font-weight:600; ">“I didn’t go to my nieces wedding, because I didn’t want to fly and I didn’t want my family and friends to see me. I think at that very moment, sitting on my couch alone, I knew I needed to make a change." </span>
            ...And that's exactly what she did. In September of 2015, Anna vowed to lose weight ...without the surgery, which her doctor recommended.

            
            <br><br>


            Coincidentally, at the same time, speaking with a family friend who happened to be an endocrinologist, Anna learned about a specialized strain of products that eliminate obesity by targeting the <a href="intro_1.html#tolerance" style="font-weight: 600;" target=" _blank">tolerance buildup.</a>

            It was then Anna realized how much of her weight gain wasn’t her fault.

 <br><br>

           <span style="font-style: italic; color:#333;  font-weight:600; "> “I just started crying,” said Anna. “And I couldn’t stop. I tried so hard to lose weight before, but nothing ever happened, and I blamed myself.” </span>
            <br><br>
            Anna knew she was ready to make a change and the most important step was to choose the right product. One of those her friend was telling her about. She went to Google and searched the phrase her friend had given her - <a href="intro_1.html#tolerance" style="font-weight: 600; color: #0e00b6;" target=" _blank">“Tolerance Prevention Weight Loss" <a>



            <center><a href="intro_1.html#tolerance" target=" _blank"><img style=" margin: 20px 0px; width: 100%; max-width: 618px; " src="images/gs.jpg"></a> </center>

                She found a product called "Slimfy”. It turned out to be the only one formulated with <a href="intro_1.html#tolerance" target=" _blank" style="font-weight: 600;">The Tolerance Suppression Method in mind.</a>

                In terms of her diet, Anna swapped out white bread and refined pastas for whole grains and cut back on fast food and soda. She also bought a new scale, so she could weigh herself regularly. After just three months of Slimfy, Anna had dropped 36 kilograms and was full of energy. She started taking longer walks and going out more.
        </a></a></div>

        <div class="contText open-sans">
            <div class="inner" style="max-width: 600px;">
                <div class="Slabo27px-Regular" style=" font-style: italic;  padding-bottom: 20px;">...I really had no idea how much this was going to change my life.”</div>
                <img width="550" src="images/story4.jpg">
            </div>
            As she lost more weight, Anna decided to make more positive changes in her life. She eventually left her job and her marriage, realizing that both were making her miserable. She began hiking, dancing, and even dating someone new. She just completed her first 5K recently.
            <br> <br>
            In the end, Anna was able to lose over half of her body weight and throw away her diabetes medication. But most importantly she found herself and the happiness she always sought. All through one simple discovery.

            Putting Slimfy Progressive Weight Loss to the Test
        </div>
        <div class="contText open-sans">
            For the InShape Daily test, it was inevitable that I was to be the guinea pig for this diet. I was about to get married and wanted to lose 15 pounds for my wedding. In order to try Slimfy, I ordered all three stages online. Although there are many similar products available, I chose Slimfy on the basis that it had been clinically tested and approved at GNP Labs in Los Angeles, California - an organization renowned for their strict guidelines on weight management products.
            <br><br>
            Our office is in London, fortunately   <span style="font-weight: 600; color:#333;  ">Slimfy ships world-wide</span> and it arrived in 5 days of placing order online.

            <div class="head1 Slabo27px-Regular">WEEK 1</div>
            <div class="contText open-sans">
                After one week on the diet using Slimfy - Stage 1 I was surprised at the dramatic results. My energy level was up, and I wasn't even hungry. A welcomed effect of the Slimfy diet is its power to curb the appetite. Best of all, I didn't change anything about my daily routine. On Day 10, I got on the scale and couldn't believe my eyes. I had lost 3.2 kg. Still, I wasn't convinced. Since they say you may lose or retain lot of water weight at the beginning of any diet, I wanted to wait and see the results in the upcoming weeks. But… it sure was looking up! I finally weighed under 80 kg. for the first time in years!

            <div class="head1 Slabo27px-Regular">WEEK 3</div>
            <div class="contText open-sans">
                After three weeks of using the product, I had even more energy. I was actually sleeping more soundly than before. I was no longer waking up in the middle of the night and tossing and turning because my body was actually able to relax (What I read in the included regimen guide booklet, this is a result of getting rid of the toxins). Plus, I still managed to lose another 4 kg, putting me at an unbelievable 7 kg. of weight loss, in just 3.5 weeks. I must admit, I’m starting to believe this method combined in 3-stage product is more than just a gimmick.

            <div class="contText open-sans">
                After a month and a half, all my doubts and skepticism had absolutely vanished! I am down, 2 full dress sizes after losing another 4 kg. And I still have a ton of energy. Quite often, I’ve noticed around the 5th week of other diets, you tend to run out of steam. But with Slimfy my energy levels don't dip (that’s also explained by the manufacturer thanks to highest grade saffron included in the formula), instead my energy remains steady throughout the day. I no longer need that cat nap around three in the afternoon! I’m even noticing that my digestion is so much better. No bloating or embarrassing gas after I eat.

                After a month and a half, all my doubts and skepticism had absolutely vanished! I am down, 2 full dress sizes after losing another 4 kg. And I still have a ton of energy. Quite often, I’ve noticed around the 5th week of other diets, you tend to run out of steam. But with Slimfy my mood and energy levels don't dip (that’s also explained by the manufacturer, thanks to the highest grade saffron included in the formula), my mood and energy remain steady throughout the day. I no longer need that cat nap around three in the afternoon! I’m even noticing that my digestion is so much better. No bloating or embarrassing gas after I eat.
                <br>
                <br>
                Anyway, I couldn't be any happier with the results. I lost almost 12 kg in 9 Weeks, No Special Diet, No Intense Exercise.

            say it is. It's one of the&nbsp;&nbsp;secret anti-aging products that
            nobody seems to want to share. I&nbsp;wouldn't be surprised many
            celebrities know about this.  I'm so
