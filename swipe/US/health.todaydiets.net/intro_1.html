I lost a total of 10 lbs after taking this supplement for one month. It's a nice alternative to working out since I'm a very busy person. I didn't even change my diet the whole time I was taking this. Overall, it worked for me and it is great.

I lost 20 lbs in two and half months by taking this slimfy weight loss. It's inexpensive and effective so I'm giving it five stars. Now I maintain my weight by eating clean and running everyday. I don't recall any negative side effects. Thanks You for such great product.

The Three Progressive Stages were created to prevent The Tolerance with the unique balance of highly potent, pure ingredients. Each stage is designed to gradually increase results of the weight loss process.

Physical tolerance occurs when an organism builds up a resistance to the effects of a substance after repeated exposure. Decreased quantity of the substance reaching the site it affects. This is usually caused by an increase in induction of the enzymes required for degradation of the supplement. In other words, tolerance is a reduced response to repeated administration of the same dose or increase in the dose is required to produce the same magnitude of response. Once we begin to take supplement on a regular basis the dose response goes down - the same dose of medication produces less effect than it used to. Saying that the dose response to medication goes down is exactly the same as saying that medication tolerance goes up (and vice versa). Dose response and tolerance are mirror images of each other. As long as a steady use of medication is maintained, tolerance will tend to increase and dose response will tend to drop. In order to avoid this and get the expected result switching the products to those with different content or adding new ingredients is required. </div> </div> <div class="landing_div5"> <div style="float:left; margin:50px 0px 0px 90px; with:400px; height:auto; "> <img src="images/slimfy-metabolic-activity-chart.jpg" width="389" height="265" border="0" alt="Slimfy Matabolic Activity Comparison Chart" title="Slimfy Matabolic Activity Comparison Chart"> </div> <div style=" float:right; width:440px; margin:30px 40px 0px 0px;"> <h1 style=" white-space:nowrap; font-size:25px; line-height:28px;"> You have nothing to lose <br> ...Except for the belly fat </h1> <div style=" width:430px; "> <p style="margin:10px 0px 0px 0px;"> Our formulas include some of the most effective, weight loss ingredients in the market: Green Coffee Bean Extract, Raspberry Ketone, Caralluma Fimbriata and more.

Tried something new about twice a year. That was until a friend showed me Slimfy. It is AMAZING! I started at 240 lbs and after going though just Stage 1 and 2 I have dropped to 212 lbs. I have never felt more energized or healthier. I highly recommend it. What’s was important to me, It is all-natural, vegan and non-gmo. I am EXCITED to continue now with Stage 3 and go through this cycle one more time." </p> </div> </div> <div class="testamony_div2"> <div class="shaddow"> </div> <div class="left"> <a class="testim julie" youtube-link="//www.youtube.com/embed/V_55WR3jU_8?rel=0&wmode=transparent&autoplay=1" href="watch_5.html" target="_blank" youtube-width="450" youtube-height="300"></a> <!--<iframe width="450" height="300" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/V_55WR3jU_8?rel=0&wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen> </iframe>--> </div> <div class="right"> <div class="rating"> <div class="stars"> <img src="images/rating-stars.png" width="106" height="20" border="0"> </div> <div class="date"> 10.13.2016 </div> </div> <div class="cutomer_details"> <strong> Julieanne O'Connor </strong> <br> <span style="font-size:13px;"> Trainer, Speaker & Author.

I also take it 30 minutes before a workout and it gives me that extra energy to stay focused. I have lost 10.5 lbs since I started using it. I have been using the product for 5 weeks and like how it reduces my appetite. I gave one to my husband and he fell in love with them, he says they lowered his appetite as well. He asks for a pill in the morning now, which is unusual for him. I saw these products advertised on TV shows and decided to give them a try. I saw results after just two weeks. I am super happy I gave it a try! - Strongly suggest." </p> </div> </div> <div class="testamony_div2"> <div class="shaddow"> </div> <div class="left"> <a class="testim steve" youtube-link="//www.youtube.com/embed/xh-q2zpxXlg?rel=0&wmode=transparent&autoplay=1" href="watch_7.html" target="_blank" youtube-width="450" youtube-height="300"></a> <!--<iframe width="450" height="300" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/xh-q2zpxXlg?rel=0&wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen> </iframe>--> </div> <div class="right"> <div class="rating"> <div class="stars"> <img src="images/rating-stars.png" width="106" height="20" border="0"> </div> <div class="date"> 08.15.2016 </div> </div> <div class="cutomer_details"> <strong> Steve D'Angelo </strong> <br> <span style="font-size:13px;"> Court Clerk.

But in the short amount of time I have been taking it I have seen great results! I don't have a lot to lose and already I lost about 3.5 pounds in first 2 weeks without changing my diet, I found it to be a wonderful appetite suppressant and energy boost. I've been on it for about 5 weeks and have lost over 10 lbs with NO change to my diet and NO excercise routine. I am contemplating speeding up the process with a gym routine but as of now, my only exercise to is remember to take the pill 30 minutes prior to eating." </p> </div> </div> <div class="testamony_div2"> <div class="shaddow"> </div> <div class="left"> <a class="testim lidia" youtube-link="//www.youtube.com/embed/-1w8xO0VdPQ?rel=0&wmode=transparent&autoplay=1" href="watch_6.html" target="_blank" youtube-width="450" youtube-height="300"></a> <!--<iframe width="450" height="300" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/-1w8xO0VdPQ?rel=0&wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen> </iframe>--> </div> <div class="right"> <div class="rating"> <div class="stars"> <img src="images/rating-stars.png" width="106" height="20" border="0"> </div> <div class="date"> 05.02.2016 </div> </div> <div class="cutomer_details"> <strong> Lidia </strong> <br> <span style="font-size:13px;"> Fashion / Personal Stylist.

I'm done with the Stage 1 and just started Stage 2. Not sure what to expect. I've been trying many other supplements even my doctor prescribed me something but my wife (she is kind of a health freak) she didn't approve it. This stuff really surprised me, the first time I can honestly say I have experienced something dramatic from taking supplements. I'm down 14.5 Lbs and that's after a little bit over a month.
