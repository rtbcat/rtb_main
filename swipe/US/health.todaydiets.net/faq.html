These donations typically come from manufacturers, suppliers, and/or distributors that can package the items in bulk, palletize them and transport them directly to Red Cross sites. Financial contributions allow the Red Cross to purchase exactly what is needed for a disaster relief operation. Monetary donations also enable the Red Cross to purchase relief supplies close to the disaster site which avoids delays and transportation costs in getting basic necessities to disaster victims. Because the affected community has generally experienced significant economic loss, purchasing relief supplies in or close to the disaster site also helps to stimulate the weakened local economy.</font></p>

				<font kerning="1">The Red Cross is unable to accept individual donations or collections: The American Red Cross understands that during times of disaster, donors are moved to help victims by the images they see and hear in the media. But the Red Cross does not accept or solicit individual donations or collections of items due to logistical constraints that are often associated with the acceptance of them. Items such as collections of food, used clothing and shoes must be sorted, cleaned, repackaged and transported which impedes the valuable resources of money, time, and personnel. The Red Cross, in partnership with other agencies, suggests that the best use for these types of donations is to support non-profit organizations within your community.</font>

				<font kerning="1">The American Red Cross provides opportunities to learn more through its international humanitarian law program that offers an introductory level course that raises awareness about the Geneva Conventions, the basic rules of international humanitarian law, and the role of the Red Cross during armed conflict. Through a hands-on approach utilizing group activities, class discussion and compelling multimedia, this course invites participants to reflect on their images and perceptions of armed conflict and explore the powerful and fundamental concept of human dignity even in the midst of war. The American Red Cross also offers the Exploring Humanitarian Law educational toolkit for students and educators. To find out if a chapter near you is offering the half-day course or other opportunities, please <a href="http://www.redcross.org/find-your-local-chapter" target="_blank">contact your local chapter</a> or email us at at EHL@redcross.org.</font>

The program was first developed in 2000 as a partnership between the American Red Cross of Greater Chicago and W.W. Grainger, Inc. With the support of W.W. Grainger, Inc. as the National Founding Sponsor, RWTC rolled out as a national pilot program limited to a number of chapters. The goal of the three-year pilot program was to have 16 chapters working in partnership with 100+ corporate partners with several thousand trained RWTC volunteers in place and to have created a model that can be efficiently replicated nationwide. With the success of the demonstration project the RWTC program has grown and is now available in several American Red Cross chapters across the country. Please check with your local Red Cross for more information on program locations.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font kerning="1"></font></p><p align="LEFT"><font kerning="1">Please contact Marcela Espinoza, National RWTC Program Manager at <a href="mailto:marcela.espinoza@redcross.org" target="_blank">marcela.espinoza@redcross.org</a> or (917) 416-9004.</font></p>

				<font kerning="1">RWTC is a &quot;top down&quot; program, where the management of a company signs on before employees are recruited. The recruitment of volunteers for RWTC is usually conducted by the partner company itself. (Some companies send e-mails or post information about the program on an Intranet site. Others place it in the company newsletter). Companies partner with their local Red Cross chapter, recruiting employees as volunteers who then are trained by the chapter as disaster-response volunteers. Partner companies commit to making these employees available for service at least one day per year. When a local, large-scale disaster occurs, the Red Cross contacts their RWTC company liaisons, who then call their RWTC employee volunteers into action. The chapter then assumes responsibility for their deployment and management.</font>

We normally do not indemnify another party in these situations. Also, workers’ compensation does not extend to volunteers in most situations.

				<font kerning="1">When countries become signatories to the Geneva Conventions, their governments agree to apply certain protections to non-combatants (POWs, civilians, etc.) during armed conflict. They also agree to help people locate family members separated by armed conflict. Each country is required to establish a single Red Cross or Red Crescent that works with other members in this global network to trace missing relatives, among other responsibilities. Clara Barton, founder of the American Red Cross, started tracing during the American Civil War when she carried messages between wounded soldiers and their families. More than a century later, the American Red Cross continues to provide information, comfort and relief to families separated by wars, disasters and other humanitarian emergencies.</font>

				<font kerning="1">Throughout the program, the interns will benefit from a substantive professional experience as well as exposure to critical issues in nonprofit management and the nonprofit sector. We disseminate information about available career opportunities in the American Red Cross. In addition, there are a series of networking and personal development opportunities, which include meeting with Red Cross senior leadership. We present significant projects to interns that require students to apply their previous knowledge and skills in an actual work setting. By taking part in this experience, students greatly enhance their chances for securing employment at an organization or corporation after graduation.</font>
