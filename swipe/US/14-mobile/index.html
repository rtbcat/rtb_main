<h3>GENERAL</h3>
<p><a class="toggle-question" href="#">What is Pure Colon Detox and why should I use it?</a></p>
<div class="toggle-box">
<p>Pure Colon Detox is an orally-administered capsule based formula. When taken on a regular basis, Pure Colon Detox offers a colon (large intestine) cleansing effect whereby your body is cleaned from toxins that have been accumulating in your body for years and years.</p>
<p>Once digested, the Pure Colon Detox formula (made from natural active extracts such as Fennel Seed, Licorice Root, Rhubarb and Aloe Vera) reaches your large intestine. There it passes through while dissolving unhealthy bacteria and food residues. As your body flushes everything out, you will get rid of those built-up toxins. The good thing is that while Pure Colon Detox cleans your body from the inside, it enriches your body and skin with beneficial agents and relieves bloating and constipation.</p>
</div>
<p><a class="toggle-question" href="#">Is it safe to use?</a></p>
<div class="toggle-box">
<p>Yes! The natural based formula of Pure Colon Detox is safe to take on a daily basis. In fact, the recommended dose is 2 capsules per day.</p>

<p>Many people advocate colonic irrigation, where fluids are forced into your colon through your rectum and then flush out. Needless to say, this is not a pleasant experience, and there are no conclusive studies that show that this, indeed is the best way to detoxify your colon and body. The human body is not meant to undergo such aggressive treatments. Pure Colon Detox works the natural way - taking it orally and letting it go through your body as food and fluids usually do. Why put yourself through unnatural experiences if the same result is achieved in a more pleasant way?</p>
</div>
<p><a class="toggle-question" href="#">How do you take Pure Colon Detox?</a></p>
<div class="toggle-box">
<p>The recommended dose is 2 capsules per day. Each bottle of Pure Colon Detox offers a full month's supply (60 capsules). It is recommended that you take each capsule with a full glass of water, and drink plenty of fluids throughout the day. For best results, it is recommended that you take a daily dose on a long-term basis. This way it ensures your body remains clean and free of bloating and constipation for as long as you take it.</p>

<h3>FREE TRIAL &amp; SUBSCRIPTION ORDERS</h3>
<p><a class="toggle-question" href="#">What is it made of?</a></p>
<div class="toggle-box">
<p>Each Pure Colon Detox capsule offers 1800mg of proprietary formula made up of natural ingredients: Fennel Seed, Cascara Sagrada, Ginger, Goldenseal, Pumpkin Seed, Buckthorn Root, Licorice Root, Rhubarb, Citrus Pectin, Acidophilus, Acai, Cape Aloe, Bentonite Clay, Aloe Vera, Cayenne Pepper, Senna, Oat Bran, Prune Juice and Flax Seed Oil.</p>

<p><a class="toggle-question" href="#">What is the Auto-Refill Program?</a></p>
<div class="toggle-box">
<p>The Auto-Refill Program is the easiest way for you to receive a regular monthly supply of Pure Colon Detox. Since the best results are achieved when it is taken on a continual, long-term basis, the Auto-Refill Program guarantees that you receive a new 60-capsule bottle by the time the one you have at home runs out.</p>
</div>
<p><a class="toggle-question" href="#">How does it work?</a></p>
<div class="toggle-box">
<p>Once your Pure Colon Detox free trial order is confirmed (you will receive an email from us), you will have 15 calendar days to decide if it's right for you (i.e. Trial Period). During this trial period you will be able to decide if you want to enroll in the Pure Colon Detox Auto-Refill Program, or if you want to return the free bottle.</p>
<p>If you do not contact us during the trial period, we will regard it as your consent to enroll in the Auto-Refill Program. This means we will charge you as follows:</p>
<p>15 calendar days following the date of your free trial order's confirmation we will charge you the amount of block type="bpwebsite/variables_product_price" (the retroactive payment of the trial bottle)</p>
<p>30 calendar days after the date of your free trial order's confirmation we will charge you the amount of block type="bpwebsite/variables_product_price" plus shipping and send you a 60-capsule bottle of Pure Colon Detox. This will essentially be your first auto-refill order. Every 30 calendar days after we will charge you the same amount as described above and ship it to your address.</p>
<p>For the Auto-Refill Program orders we will use the shipping address and payment method you provided at the time you claimed your free Pure Colon Detox bottle. We will also regard your free trial order's selected shipping method as the primary shipping method for all subsequent Auto-Refill orders.</p>
<p>Your payment may be processed in various international currencies and not the currency displayed during checkout. This may cause currency exchange rate differences and you should check your credit card statement to view the charge in the actual currency.</p>
</div>
<p><a class="toggle-question" href="#">What happens if I want to stop my auto-refill membership?</a></p>
<div class="toggle-box">
<p>If you do not wish to be a member of our Auto-Refill Program, please contact us before the end of your Trial Period (i.e. 15 calendar days following the date of your free trial order's confirmation date). This way you will not see any additional charges except for the shipping fees of your free trial bottle.</p>
<p>If you would like to cancel your membership in the Auto-Refill Program and your Trial period has already ended, please <a href="/contacts'">contact us</a> with an explicit request to cancel your membership. We will cancel any future Pure Colon Detox charges and shipments associated with your account, but we will be unable to refund any charges made up until your cancellation request date.</p>

Research it thoroughly and/or consult with an appropriately qualified practitioner or expert. If you are taking prescription drugs, or have a medical condition check with an appropriately qualified practitioner before using herbs medicinally. Herbs have shown overwhelming evidence that they work. Just because a small amount works well does NOT mean that more is better. As individuals we all have different constitutions, sensitivities, allergic reactions and possible health conditions. The following are merely guidelines. They include herbs offered on our websites. This list does not help with administering information on possible interactions and contraindications with prescription medicine. This needs to be discussed with your physician.            <br>Should I check with my doctor or healthcare provider before using a supplement?            <br>This is a good idea, especially for certain population groups. Dietary supplements may not be risk-free under certain circumstances. If you are pregnant, nursing a baby, or have a chronic medical condition, such as, diabetes, hypertension or heart disease, be sure to consult your doctor or pharmacist before purchasing or taking any supplement. While vitamin and mineral supplements are widely used and generally considered safe, you may wish to check with your doctor or pharmacist before taking these or any other dietary supplements. If you plan to use a dietary supplement in place of drugs or in combination with any drug, tell your health care provider first. Many supplements contain active ingredients that have strong biological effects and their safety is not always assured in all users. If you have certain health conditions and take these products, you may be placing yourself at risk.            <br>Some supplements may interact with prescription and over-the-counter medicines.            <br>Taking a combination of supplements or using these products together with medications (whether prescription or OTC drugs) could under certain circumstances produce adverse effects. Be alert to advisories about these products, whether taken alone or in combination. For example: Coumadin (a prescription medicine), ginkgo biloba (an herbal supplement), aspirin (an OTC drug) and vitamin E (a vitamin supplement) can each thin the blood, and taking any of these products together can increase the potential for internal bleeding.            <br>Some supplements can have unwanted effects during surgery.            <br>It is important to fully inform your doctor about the vitamins, minerals, herbals or any other supplements you are taking, especially before elective surgery. You may be asked to stop taking these products at least 2-3 weeks ahead of the procedure to avoid potentially dangerous supplement/drug interactions -- such as changes in heart rate, blood pressure and increased bleeding - that could adversely affect the outcome of your surgery.            <br>Not to be used during pregnancy, or if you are nursing:            <br>Alkanet, Aloe, Angelica, Anise, Anise Star, Arnica, Ashwaganda, Barley Grass, Barberry, Basil, Bitter Melon, Black Cohosh, Bladderwrack, Blessed Thistle, Blood Root, Blue Cohosh, Blue Flag, Blue Vervain, Borage, Buckthorn, California Poppy, Cascara Sagrada, Catnip, Celandine, Celery, Chervil, Cinnamon, Club Moss, Comfrey, Coltsfoot, Cubeb, Dong Quai, Elecampane, Ephedra, False Unicorn, Fenugreek, Feverfew, Ginger, Golden Seal, Gravel, Guarana, Gymnema, Horehound, Horsetail, Hyssop, Juniper, Lemongrass, Licorice, Lobelia, Lovage, Lungwort, Mace, Motherwort, Mugwort, Muira Puama, Myrrh, Neem, Oregon Grape, Osha, Parsley, Pennyroyal, Pleurisy, Prickly Ash, Red Clover, Rhodiola, Rosemary, Rue, Sage, Sassafras, Sarsaparilla, Senna, Shepherds Purse, Spikenard, Turkey Rhubarb, Turmeric, Uva Ursi, Vitex, Watercress, White Sage, Wormwood, Yarrow            <br>Not for persons with history of kidney stones, liver disorders, renal dysfunction or inflammation.             <br>Cubeb, Essiac, Horsetail, Hydrangea, Juniper Berries, Kava Kava, Parsley Root, Pennyroyal, Sheep Sorrel, Shepherds Purse, Suma, Sumac, Uva Ursi, Yellowdock, Yohimbe            <br>Not recommended for person currently taking blood thinning medications:            <br>Alfalfa, Angelica, Cramp Bark, Cubeb, Dong Quai, Ginkgo, Meadowsweet, Red Clover, Sarsaparilla, Yohimbe            <br>Not for persons with stomach inflammation/ulcers serious digestion and/or liver problems.
