Lenders may include banks, thrifts and credit unions, as well as mortgage bankers and mortgage brokers.  If you grant us authorization, BILLS.COM will use your personal information to obtain and use your credit report and/or credit score on your behalf for the purpose of estimating your qualification for the loans offered in our lender network and the pricing thereof. BILLS.COM also provides access to the credit report and score so obtained for your own use. In addition, you may find yourself at BILLS.COM by transfer from a third party through whom you've requested mortgage loan referral information. BILLS.COM does not charge you for using this mortgage loan request service however in exchange for the use of this service, you agree to talk to at least one of the members of our network, chosen by you or if not, selected for you, about your mortgage loan options. BILLS.COM may be compensated for such service directly by the lenders themselves.  By using the websites you acknowledge that BILLS.COM does not make loans or credit decisions in connection with any product or service offered to you, does not warrant or guarantee the products or services of any Lender or any particular loan product and is not party to any discussions that you may have or agreement that you may make with any lender and the determination of whether a particular loan offer from a particular lender is appropriate for your circumstances is entirely yours.  While we may not initially provide your loan request information to more than one lender (as chosen by you), we reserve the right to provide said information to other lenders as we deem fit.  BILLS.COM is not an agent of you or any Lender and our services are purely administrative.  We advise that you rely on your own judgment in deciding which available loan product, terms and lender best comports with your needs and financial means.  You are under no obligation to complete a loan with any lender to which you are introduced through BILLS.COM.  Remember, the lender is solely responsible for its products and/or services to you, and you agree that BILLS.COM shall not be liable for any damages or costs of any type arising out of or in any way connected with your use of such products and/or services.
