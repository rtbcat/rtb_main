The Search Applications provide features to facilitate Internet search and communication services, including through the MyWay, MyWebSearch search portals and email services.  This search functionality may be implemented through browser settings and “extensions” that set or default your browser homepage, start page, new tab page and/or default search setting(s), depending on which MS Service you are using and what options you select. If you do not wish to reset your setting(s) in this way, you can decline or opt-out of the setting(s) change by unchecking the appropriate checkbox during the download and installation process for the relevant MS product that provides access to the MS Services. Certain MS products, such as Chrome new tab products, may be available through the online store operated by the browser developer (e.g., the Chrome web store) and the user disclosures and options may vary based on the store’s requirements. The search features, as well as other non-search-related features, may be customized by you.  In addition, you can disable or remove the default these search features by removing or disabling the applicable files you downloaded from the MS Services, depending on your browser, browser version, and tools and features provided in your respective browser.

				<div class="para">The exclusive means of resolving any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including any alleged breach thereof), the MS Services, or the Website shall be BINDING ARBITRATION administered by the American Arbitration Association. The one exception to the exclusivity of arbitration is that you have the right to bring an individual claim against the Company in a small-claims court of competent jurisdiction. But whether you choose arbitration or small-claims court, you may not under any circumstances commence or maintain against the Company any class action, class arbitration, or other representative action or proceeding.</div>
				<div class="para">By using the MS Services in any manner, you agree to the above arbitration agreement. In doing so, YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend any claims between you and the Company (except for matters that may be taken to small-claims court). AS FURTHER SET FORTH IN SECTION 14, YOU ALSO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER CLASS PROCEEDING. Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE OR JURY. You are entitled to a fair hearing before the arbitrator. The arbitrator can grant any relief that a court can, but you should note that arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons. For details on the arbitration process, see our Arbitration Procedures.</div>
				<div class="para">Any proceeding to enforce this arbitration agreement, including any proceeding to confirm, modify, or vacate an arbitration award, may be commenced in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event that this arbitration agreement is for any reason held to be unenforceable, any litigation against the Company (except for small-claims court actions) may be commenced only in the federal or state courts located in New York County, New York.

				<h1 id="ADDENDUMA" style="text-align: center">ADDENDUM A:  SUPPLEMENTAL TERMS PERTAINING TO<br> MYWAY SERVICES (THE “SUPPLEMENTAL TERMS”)</h1>
				<br>

				<div class="para">Without limiting any of the restrictions, limitations, or rights we have reserved that are set forth in the Terms of Service, the following terms also apply, if you use services provided through the <a href="http://www.myway.com/" target="_blank">www.myway.com</a> platform, including email services, and access to “MyWay”-branded or provided forums and communities (the “MyWay Services,” as defined in the above Terms of Service).</div>
				<div class="para"><span class="bold">1. Compliance With Terms of Service and these Supplemental Terms.</span>  If you fail to comply with the Terms of Service of these Supplemental Terms at any time, we reserve the right to terminate your access to all or some of the MyWay Services, which may include disabling your MyWay email account. We may discontinue or alter any aspect of the MyWay Services, including, but not limited to, (i) restricting the time the MyWay Services are available, (ii) restricting the amount of use permitted, and (iii) restricting or terminating any user's right to use the MyWay Services, at our sole discretion and without prior notice or liability. You are responsible for all charges associated with connecting to the MyWay Services. You are also responsible for obtaining or providing all access lines, including DSL, cable, or other network services or devices necessary to access the MyWay Services.</div>
				<div class="para"><span class="bold">2. Registration.</span>  In order to use certain of the MyWay Services, such as email-related services, you must provide certain registration information.  You agree that MyWay user names are our property, and we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change, remove or replace any user name for any reason. We may refuse to grant you, and you may not use, an MyWay user name that is already being used by someone else; that may be construed as impersonating another person; that belongs to another person; that violates the intellectual property or other rights of any person; that is offensive; or that we reject for any other reason in our sole discretion. Please note that your user name may be viewed by the public, so you should not choose a user name that personally identifies you unless it is your purpose to do so.</div>
				<div class="para">If you elect to register to use the MyWay Services, you agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the MyWay registration form (such information being the "Registration Data") and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it accurate. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, or incomplete, or if we have reasonable grounds to suspect that such is the case, we may suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the MyWay website and/or MyWay Services (or any portion thereof).</div>
				<div class="para">In addition to any other Registration Data we may require, to register with MyWay you will be required to choose a password and an account name. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any password you may use to access the MyWay Services, and agree not to transfer your user name or password, or lend or otherwise transfer your use of or access to the MyWay Services, to any third party. You are fully responsible for all activity that occurs in connection with your user name or password. You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your user name or password or any other breach of security related to your account or the MyWay Services, and to ensure that you "log off"/exit from your account (if applicable) at the end of each session. We are not liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with any of the foregoing obligations.</div>
				<div class="para"><span class="bold">3. MyWay's Privacy Policy.</span>  Pursuant to our Privacy Policy, we may disclose to certain third parties certain information contained in your Registration Data or related data unless you choose to opt out from such disclosures as described in the Privacy Policy. <span class="bold">Please note: opting out may restrict your ability to utilize certain of the MyWay Services.</span>  </div>
				<div class="para"><span class="bold">4. Access to Your Emails.</span>  As further set forth in our Privacy Policy, we may monitor, edit, or disclose the contents of user or member e-mails in the course of normal maintenance of the MyWay Services and its systems, or as otherwise set forth in our Privacy Policy.  Further, in order to permit us to protect the quality of its products and services, you hereby consent to our employees being able to access your account and records on a case by case basis to investigate complaints or other allegations or abuse. </div>
				<div class="para"><span class="bold">5. Forums; Email Service.</span>  Through MyWay-branded products and services, we may offer users access to Forums, and may also provide registered users with access to email services. A "Forum" refers to a bulletin board, virtual community or other means for users to engage in public commentary or discussion. Forums and e-mail services are offered for personal, non-commercial use only. You agree to not, without our express written approval, distribute or otherwise publish via any of the MyWay Services any material containing any solicitation of funds, promotion, advertising, or solicitation for goods or services.</div>
				<div class="para">As with all MyWay Services, your privilege to use MyWay email and participate in the Forums is dependent on your continued compliance with the Terms of Service and Supplemental Terms, specifically including the Community Standards and Conduct listed below. We may revoke your privileges, terminate your registration/account or take any other measures deemed by us to be appropriate, in our sole discretion, to enforce the Terms of Service and Supplemental Terms if violations are brought to our attention.</div>
				<div class="para">In addition to any other rights or remedies available to it, MyWay reserves the right to immediately suspend, terminate, access and investigate the email or user account of any user upon receipt of a subpoena or law enforcement request, or when MyWay believes, in its sole discretion, that a user is transmitting or is otherwise connected with the distribution of unsolicited bulk email messages (SPAM) or any harassing email messages, or with any fraudulent, misleading, harmful or illegal activities. Because of the difficulty associated with quantifying damages, if actual damages cannot be reasonably calculated then you agree to pay us liquidated damages of $5 for each piece of unsolicited bulk email transmitted from or otherwise connected with your account or the maximum liquidated damages permitted under law, whichever is greater; otherwise you agree to pay our actual damages, including any associated attorney’s fees, to the extent such actual damages can be reasonably calculated. </div>
				<div class="para">You should consider all Forum communications to be public and not private communications. Although we reserve the right to remove without notice any Forum posting for any reason, we have no obligation to delete content that you may find objectionable or offensive. </div>
				<div class="para">We reserve the right to monitor some, all, or no areas of the Forums for adherence to these or other rules that may be published from time to time. You acknowledge that by providing you with the ability to distribute content, we act as a passive conduit for such distribution and are not undertaking any obligation or liability relating to any content or activities in any Forum or email.</div>
				<div class="para"><span class="bold">6. Submissions.</span>  If, on your own or at our request, you submit content (e.g., postings to Forums, responses to surveys, etc.), communications, creative suggestions, ideas, notes, drawings, or other information (collectively, "Submissions"), you hereby grant us, and our corporate affiliates, a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, sub-licensable, transferable, worldwide license to use, copy, modify, incorporate into other works, display, perform, transmit and distribute such Submissions or any portion thereof, in or through any medium, whether now known or hereafter created. We shall be entitled to unrestricted use of the Submissions for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, without compensation to the submitter. You represent and warrant that you own the contents of any Submission or otherwise have sufficient rights in the Submission to grant to us the license set forth above.</div>
				<div class="para"><span class="bold">7. MyWay Email Storage and Delivery; Termination of Inactive Accounts.</span> If you obtain email services as part of the MyWay Services, the amount of email storage space per member may be limited. Email accounts may be archived at such time intervals as we or our third party service provider(s) determine in their sole discretion.  Some Email messages may not be processed due to space constraints, outbound message limitations or disruptions in the system(s). You agree that we are not responsible or liable for the deletion or failure to store messages or other information.</div>
				<div class="para"><span class="bold">Email accounts may be terminated and/or deleted from our system if they remain inactive for a period of ninety (90) or more days. In the event of a suspension or deletion of an email account, messages (whether sent, received, in draft form or archived) and address book entries will no longer be accessible.</span></div>
				<div class="para"><span class="bold">8. Additional Disclaimers Applicable to the MyWay Services.</span>  In addition to the Disclaimers of Warranties set forth in the Terms of Service, <span class="bold">Please Note</span> the below disclaimers applicable to the MyWay Services:</div>
