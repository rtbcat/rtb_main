                    <p style=""><strong>BADV</strong></p><p style="">This blocker means that an advertiser is blocked by a publisher, therefore bids from this advertisers are blocked.</p><p style=""><em>Example: There are</em><em> 10 million bids available, 2 million of which are from publishers that have blocked an advertiser, i.e. this advertiser will not be able to send bids to these 20% of publishers, so 20% of bids are blocked.</em></p><p style=""><strong>BATTR</strong></p><p style="">Refers to a blocked creative attribute (e.g. In-Banner Video Ad (Auto-Play), Text Only, Expandable (Automatic), etc.)</p><p style=""><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-external-resource" src="https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/57daad6cc697913ea646dec3/images/599d4487042863033a1c36ff/file-i8RbM1fn0U.png" data-image-src="https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/57daad6cc697913ea646dec3/images/599d4487042863033a1c36ff/file-i8RbM1fn0U.png"></span></p><p style=""><strong>BCAT</strong></p><p style="">Blocked advertiser categories (e.g. Weight Loss, Smoking Cessation, Jewelry Making, etc.).</p><p style="">Corresponds to <span> </span><a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.iab.com/guidelines/iab-quality-assurance-guidelines-qag-taxonomy/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">IAB categories</a>.</p><p style=""><strong>Bidfloor</strong></p><p style="">The share of bids blocked due to the price that is passed in a bid request by publisher (comparing to your campaign CPM).</p><p style=""><em>Example: </em><em>Your CPM is $0.5, but a publisher’s bidfloor is $1. In this case your bidding for traffic from this publisher is blocked.</em></p><p style=""><strong>Bids per user</strong></p><p style="">This blocker is applied artificially to set a bid limit for a user in order not to exceed targeting per user cap.</p><p style=""><strong>Bids throttling</strong></p><p style="">This means we either limit or increase the probability of sending bids by your campaign.</p><p style=""><em>Example: </em><em>If you sent 1 million bids in the previous 10 minutes, we allow to send 5x more bids in the next 10 minutes (5 million bids). On the contrary, if your campaign sent 1000 bids in the last 10 minutes, you’ll be allowed to send only 200 bids within next 10 minutes.</em></p><p style="">This is an automatic system, so once you start actively bidding again, our system will increase the number of bids it receives.</p><p style=""><strong>BROWSERS list</strong></p><p style="">Blocks the bids to the browsers other than chosen in the campaign</p><p style=""><em>Example: </em><em>If you target Chrome, all traffic from Mozilla FireFox browser is blocked for a campaign. Let's say, w</em><em>e have 10 million requests, 6 million are from Chrome browser and 4 million are from other browsers. If you target Chrome, you will be able to send bids to 6 million (60%) of all requests, so 40% will be blocked.</em></p><p style=""><strong>BTYPE</strong></p><p style="">Bids limited by blocked banner ad type as per OpenRTB specification.

Even budget pacing means the campaign budget is spent evenly during the day, asap - that the budget is spent as soon as possible (provided that there is traffic matching your demand).</p><p style=""><em>Example: </em><em>Your budget limit for today is 10 dollars but it is only 3 p.m. and these 10 dollars has been already spent. In such cases bids from your campaign will be blocked after 3 p.m.</em></p><p style=""><strong>Campaign per user cap</strong></p><p style="">Blocks the bids if you set a campaign frequency cap (the number of times your ad appears to the same person).</p><p style=""><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-external-resource" src="https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/57daad6cc697913ea646dec3/images/59a7d6a32c7d3a73488c749a/file-1VnZFHVfPC.png" data-image-src="https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/57daad6cc697913ea646dec3/images/59a7d6a32c7d3a73488c749a/file-1VnZFHVfPC.png"></span></p><p style=""><strong>CARRIERS list</strong></p><p style="">Refers to the bids blocked due to mobile carriers out of your targeting.</p><p style=""><strong>CLICK_REDIRECT macros requirement (google)</strong></p><p style="">Refers only to strategies targeting Google DoubleClick. Google DoubleClick requires using macros. This blocker means your creative is missing necessary  marcos. Please use [UNENCODED_CLICK_REDIRECT] and [ENCODED_CLICK_REDIRECT] macros to get your creative approved.</p><p style=""><strong>Contextual segments</strong></p><p style="">If you’ve chosen Forensiq, In-house fraud protection solutions and Integral Ad Science filters in contextual segments, bid to traffic outside these segments are blocked.</p><p style=""><strong>Device connection type</strong></p><p style="">Refers to the connection type:</p><ul style=""><li>Unknown</li><li>Wi-Fi</li><li>Ethernet</li><li>Cellular Unknown</li><li>Cellular 2G</li><li>Cellular 3G</li><li>Cellular 4G</li></ul><p style=""><em>E.g., targeting only Cellular Unknown will block bids to all other connection types.</em></p><p style=""><em>Example: We</em><em> have 10 million requests, 6 million of which are requests with Wi-Fi device connection type. If you have chosen Wi-Fi device connection type, you will be able to send bids only to this 6 million requests, i.e. 40% of bids will be blocked.</em></p><p style=""><strong>DEVICES list</strong></p><p style="">Limits the bids due to the device chosen in a campaign (computer, mobile, tablet or other).</p><p style=""><em>Example: </em><em>If we have 10 million requests in total, and 8 million of them are from computer devices and you have chosen a mobile (or tablet or other) device, 8 million (80%) of bids will be blocked.</em></p><p style=""><strong>Doubleclick Billing ID</strong></p><p style="">Refers only to the campaigns targeting Google DoubleClick as a supply source. Particular billing IDs belong to specific seats on Google.</p><p style=""><strong>Forensiq score</strong></p><p style="">If Forensiq score is chosen in a campaign, bids to publisher with high risk (as per Forensiq fraud detection) will be blocked.</p><p style=""><em>Example: </em><em>We have 10 million requests, 2 million of which were detected as fraud by Forensiq. If you have chosen Forensiq score, 20% of bids will be blocked. </em></p><p style=""><strong>GEO lists</strong></p><p style="">You can send bids only to the GEOs whitelisted in the campaign. Traffic from all other GEOs is blocked.</p><p style=""><em>Example: </em><em>We have 10 million requests and 8 million is from the USA and 2 million is from the UK. You target the UK, i.e. 80 per cent of requests are blocked because of the GEO, and you will be able to send bids to only 20% (2 million) of all requests.</em></p><p style=""><strong>Internal auction</strong></p><p style="">This blocker means that you cannot send bids as other advertiser won the auction internally (within our exchange due a higher CPM).</p><p style=""><strong>Inventory type</strong></p><p style="">Depending on the inventory type you have chosen (web/ in-app/ both), you’ll be able to send bids only for web/ in-app/ both types.</p><p style=""><em>Example: </em><em>We have 10 million requests: 8 million are from web and 2 million are from in-app traffic. If you have chosen only web inventory type, you will be able to send bids only to 8 million requests. 2 million (20%) of traffic will be blocked.</em></p><p style=""><strong>IPs lists</strong></p><p style="">Refers to IP white/ black lists. Limits bids to the IPs that are not added to your white/ black list.</p><p style=""><em>Example: </em><em>We have 10 million requests. If you have blocked some IPs from which we have 2 million requests, you will not be able to receive these requests, i.e. 20 per cent of traffic will be blocked.</em></p><p style=""><em>Please note if you whitelist IPs you will be able to receive traffic only from these IPs.</em></p><p style=""><strong>Only in-network activity</strong></p><p style="">Bids can be limited due to the settings applied to the network. Only in-network traffic means an advertiser can buy traffic from this network only (excluding traffic from the ad exchange (comprising all white label platforms).</p><p style=""><strong>OS lists</strong></p><p style="">Blocks bids out of the OS chosen in the strategy. For example, targeting Android will block bids you could potentially send to iOS.</p><p style=""><em>Example: </em><em>We have 10 million requests, 7 million of which are Android traffic. If you have chosen Android OS, you will be able to send bids only to 70% of traffic, so 30% of bids will be blocked.</em></p><p style=""><strong>PMP</strong></p><p style="">Used only when Private Marketplace Deal is chosen instead of Open Supply at the strategy level. Bids to Open Supply traffic are blocked.</p><p style=""><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-external-resource" src="https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/57daad6cc697913ea646dec3/images/599d449d2c7d3a73488c3a72/file-QVh18t2WHB.png" data-image-src="https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/57daad6cc697913ea646dec3/images/599d449d2c7d3a73488c3a72/file-QVh18t2WHB.png"></span></p><p style=""><strong>Secure type</strong></p><p style="">Refers to the creative type: HTTP or Universal (HTTPS).

If your creatives have HTTP secure type, 40% of traffic (4 million) will be blocked.</em></p><p style=""><strong>Size</strong></p><p style="">This blocker refers to the creative sizes assigned to a campaign. Please note the most popular creative sizes are 320x50 and 300x250. If you target 970x250, for example, bids for traffic with all other creative sizes are blocked.</p><p style=""><em>Example: </em><em>We have 10 million requests, 4 million are for creatives with 320x50 size and 6 million are for creatives with different sizes. If you have chosen to target 320x50 creatives, you will be able to send only 4 million bids, i.e. 60% of traffic will be blocked.</em></p><p style=""><strong>Sites</strong></p><p style="">Block a portion of bids due to white/ black list of the sites chosen in the campaign.</p><p style=""><em>Example: </em><em>We have 10 million requests. If you have blocked some sites from which we have 2 million traffic, you will not be able to send bids to them, i.e. 20% of traffic will be blocked.</em></p><p style=""><em>Please note if you whitelist sites you will be able to receive traffic only from these sites.</em></p><p style=""><strong>Source frequency cap (bid per user)</strong></p><p style="">A cap set for a user to limit the number of bids per source.</p><p style=""><strong>SSP test phase</strong></p><p style="">Bids blocked due to the phase the SSP endpoint is set to. Phase I and II refer to test phases. This blocker disappears once the SSP endpoint is switch to live environment (production phase).</p><p style=""><strong>System IP lists</strong></p><p style="">Refers to the IPs that were detected by our system as providing non-human traffic.</p><p style=""><em>Example: </em><em>We have 10 million requests and 2 million were detected as non-human, i.e. 20% of traffic will be blocked and you will not be able to send bids to it.</em></p><p style=""><strong>Targeting daily impressions, campaign daily budget</strong></p><p style="">Bids can be blocked due to the caps set for impressions and daily budget at the strategy/ campaign level.</p><p style=""><em>Example: </em><em>You have set daily impression cap at 1 million. Once your campaign receives 1 million impressions, the bids will be blocked. </em></p><p style=""><em>As for a daily spend cap, if it is set at $100, this amount will be split evenly or asap in 24 hours (based on the parameters you've chosen), but it may also influence the number of bids you are allowed to send per hour.</em></p><p style=""><em><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-external-resource" src="https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/57daad6cc697913ea646dec3/images/59a7d7eb042863033a1c716b/file-EcpkR4G5vK.png" data-image-src="https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/57daad6cc697913ea646dec3/images/59a7d7eb042863033a1c716b/file-EcpkR4G5vK.png"></span></em></p><p style=""><strong>Targeting per source cap</strong></p><p style="">Bids are blocked due Targeting per source setting in the campaign.</p><p style=""><em>Example: </em><em>We have 1 million impressions. You have set source cap at 100 thousand impressions per one source. 600 thousand impressions are availabe per one source, so 500 thousand bids will be blocked.</em></p><p style=""><strong>Targeting per user cap</strong></p><p style="">If you set daily impressions per one user (for example one visit per one user), the second and further visits will be blocked to this user.</p><p style=""><em>Example: </em><em>We have 1 million impressions. You have set 100 daily impression per one user. There was 3100 impressions per one user, i.e. 3000 bids will be blocked.</em></p><p style=""><strong>Timetable</strong></p><p style="">Bids can be blocked because of timetable set for your campaign.</p><p style=""><em>Example: </em><em>If you choose a specific day to get traffic, traffic in any other day will be blocked.</em></p><p style=""><em>We have 10 million requests every day (70 million requests per week). You have chosen to target only Monday so 60 million (85%) requests will be blocked.</em></p><p style=""><strong>User segments</strong></p><p style="">It means that bids outside of the audience segments applied to the strategy for retargeting will be blocked.</p><p style=""><strong>Useragents</strong></p><p style="">Bids to useragents outside of your targeting are blocked.</p><p style=""><strong>Video duration</strong></p><p style="">Refers to the video duration declared in the video creative (15 seconds, 30 seconds, etc.).</p><p style=""><em>Example: </em><em>We have 10 million requests, 4 million are for 15 second videos and 6 million is for videos with different duration.
